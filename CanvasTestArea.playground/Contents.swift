 Use this playground to experiment with the Canvas class.
 
 Your goals are to:
 
 * learn something about order of statements (does order matter?)
 * get familiar with using a Playground
 
 Have fun!

// Create a new canvas
let canvas = Canvas(width: 300, height: 500)

// Draw a circle at the origin with radius of 50 pixels
canvas.drawEllipse(centreX: 0, centreY: 0, width: 50, height: 50)

// View the current state of the canvas
canvas


/*:
 ## Reflect
 
 Look at the code above that was used to draw a circle at the origin.
 
 Then look at the visual output, or result, of that code, also above.
 
 What does this tell you about the location of the origin on the canvas?
 
 */

// Draw an ellipse with no fill in the middle of the canvas
canvas.drawShapesWithFill = false
canvas.drawEllipse(centreX: 150, centreY: 250, width: 50, height: 100)

// View the current state of the canvas
canvas

/*:
 ## Reflect
 
 For the ellipse just drawn, look at the *arguments* for the **centreX** and **centreY** *parameters*.
 
 What if you changed the size of your canvas?
 
 Would the ellipse still draw in the middle of the canvas, if it was resized?
 
 Try making the height of the canvas 700 pixels.
 
 Now try changing the **centreY** argument to `canvas.height / 2`
 
 What happens?
 
 This is an example of using an expression as an argument, rather than a static value.
 
 Dynamic expressions generally make your code more "flexible" and are preferred to static values.
 
 Try changing the arguments for more shapes drawn later on in this playground.
 
 Can you come up with a dynamic expression that will keep the shape in the same place as the static argument?
 
 For how many shapes can you manage to do this?
